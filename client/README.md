## About The Project

This is the frontend for the Baaloo Admin Dashboard. It provides a secure and responsive interface for administrators to log in, view application statistics, and manage other administrator accounts. It communicates with the backend server to fetch data and perform actions.

## Features

* **Secure Admin Authentication**: JWT-based login system with session persistence.
* **Responsive Dashboard**: A central hub to monitor application activity with at-a-glance statistic cards.
* **Administrator Management**:
	-	View a list of all administrators.
    -   Invite new administrators with default credentials.
    -   Edit administrator details (name, email, phone).
    -   Reset passwords for other administrators.
    -   Securely remove administrators, with a safeguard against self-deletion.
* **Modern UI/UX**:
    -   Clean, responsive layout that adapts to screen size.
    -   Interactive modals for editing and management with "click outside" and "Escape key" to close.
    -   User feedback through toast notifications for all actions.
* **Dynamic Layout**: The main content area automatically adjusts to the navbar's height.
* **Global State**: A centralized `AppContext` provides user data and authentication status to the entire application.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create an environment file:**
